Pallas
======
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mockersf/Pallas.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mockersf/Pallas)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/mockersf/Pallas/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/mockersf/Pallas)

Python application to help map a website and write tests as [page objects](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageObjects) using Selenium.
Can currently use Firefox or PhantomJS to browse, and browsermobprroxy to check http calls.


To Do
-----

* remove actions from node start
* stop redrawing nodes at random places after actions
* flow should be : input css selector -> search -> select an object -> beginning or continue -> choose action on object (click, input, ...) and order of actions -> validate connection
* going to an iframe of a page is a new page
* connection from multiple actions
* save / load current status as xml


Running Tests
-------------
Project includes a vagrant configuration with everything needed to run, and a script in /test that run pytest and starts Pallas.
```bash
$ cd vagrant
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
$ /Pallas/test/run_test.sh
```
